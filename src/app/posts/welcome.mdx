# Welcome to My Blog

Hello! I'm Santiago PÃ©rez, and this is my personal blog where I'll be sharing my thoughts and experiences.

## About me
* I work on Software Development since 3 years ago with Ruby on Rails
* I love to play chess.
* I love to study topics about personal finances.
* I love maths

## Why I Started This Blog

I decided to create this blog for two main reasons:

1. To practice my English writing skills: I've seen that there is a lot of opportunities to work remotely but I'm limited by language, so, I decided to put into practice with this blog
2. To share my ideas and experiences with the world

## What to Expect

In this blog, you'll find:

- Personal reflections
- Technical articles
- Life experiences
- And much more!

I'm excited to start this journey and share my thoughts with you. Stay tuned for more content!
